# OLIA
 Open Logical Industrial Architecture  

 OLIA is the main architecture of the [OLxA stack](https://github.com/ufrs12/OLxA) of architectures  
 

To implement this project, Armbian images are being developed in [this repository](https://github.com/ufrs12/OLIA-Linux-Armbian). And also a builder of these images in [this repository](https://github.com/ufrs12/OLIA-Linux-Armbian-builder).

Most of the work on this project was carried out in Russian. Now we are making English the main language. We will gradually translate what has already been done. For those who are not confused by the Russian language, I provide links to materials in Russian:
